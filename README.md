# The Assignment: Budget Tracker 

A budget tracker that allows users to utilize their budget application online or offline. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.

In this assignment we were tasked with taking an already working application and making it a Progressive Web Application. PWA is a relatively new term in the realm of web development because it is not always necessary to have an application function offline but this one does. By adding the manifest and service worker we have created a full stack application that will function and also add any input that was added offline when the application returns with online. It stores the data in cache and adds it back to the server when it can reconnect again. This assignment showed me a technology that is somewhat new to the full stack web development world and gave me experience working with it. I enjoyed have to develop this application and thought it was probably a good representation of something I might be tasked with in my first real world web development job.

# Lessons: 

This assignment showed me how to take an existing application and make it function as needed for the assignment. I was able to gain the experience of making the application work completely offline. When first tasked with this assignment I thought it might be a challenging accomplishment but with a quick reference to the past weeks class activities it became very clear it was not as challenging as some other assignments had been. I enjoyed this assignment and I believe I am acquiring a higher level understanding of the class as a whole which will help me on my near future career as a web developer.

# Takeaways: 

As stated above a higher level of understanding in the class as a whole of all that has been taught to me. This cohort has enlightened me to a vast amount of information that I had never experienced before and I am not sure which direction to move since it is all so new and exciting. The backend of web development has shown me such an interesting set of information but I do really enjoy seeing the idea come to fruition when working in the frontend and viewing the finished and polished application that a user can interact with and utilize all of its functionality. I have learned a lot so far and I am happy to be learning so much more into the last coming weeks of this class.
